## General guidelines

- Never use `git` operations. That's up to the user.
- Always prefer simplicity, usability and top level type safety over cleverness.
- Don't create index.ts files that re-export things from other files. Always import directly from the file you need.
- Prefer classes over standalone functions when it makes sense.
- Before doing something, check the patterns used in the rest of the codebase.

## Bun specifics
This is a Bun-only project. Never check if something might not be supported in another environment. You can assume Bun is always available.

Always use Bun features and APIs where possible.

- Use `bun <file>` instead of `node <file>` or `ts-node <file>`
- Use `bun test` instead of `jest` or `vitest`
- Use `bun build <file.html|file.ts|file.css>` instead of `webpack` or `esbuild`
- Use `bun install` instead of `npm install` or `yarn install` or `pnpm install`
- Use `bun run <script>` instead of `npm run <script>` or `yarn run <script>` or `pnpm run <script>`
- Use `bunx <package> <command>` instead of `npx <package> <command>`
- Bun automatically loads .env, so don't use dotenv.

## APIs

- Prefer `Bun.file` over `node:fs`'s readFile/writeFile
- Bun.$`ls` instead of execa.

## Testing

Always run `bun run build` before running tests, to make sure there are no build errors.
Use `bun run test` to run all the tests.

Always run `bun run test` when you think you are done making changes.

```ts#index.test.ts
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("hello world", () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});
```
